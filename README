TouchBMC is a XBMC remote controller for use with small touchscreens.
Something like YATSE, but with much less features and much bigger buttons.

Currently only a sketch of the GUI is written.

Depends on pygame and jsonrpc (https://github.com/NCMI/jsonrpc ; recent version),
but this will still change.
